# ResidentEvil4InventorySystemUnityClone
This is a short project that I created to train and practice the concept of grids in game development and programming.

# Overview
I completed this project in a little over 8 hours, relying mainly on my own ideas without much external consultation. The goal was to implement grid behavior similar to the inventory system in the classic game "Resident Evil 4" (2005). Throughout the development process, I kept the game open to closely study and replicate every aspect and behavior of its inventory system.

Feel free to explore the project and use it as a reference or learning resource for grid-related concepts in game development.
